## Project Overview: FreshCart Market

Your task is to build the customer-facing part of **FreshCart Market**, a simple grocery e-commerce website. Focus on features like product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout. You can ignore admin functionalities and user authentication for simplicity.

### Challenges

A junior developer started the project but didn't finish implementing pagination on the frontend. Your tasks are:
- Refactor the code for maintainability.
- Implement pagination with infinite scroll.

#### 2. Categories and Search

Implement a search bar and category filters:
- Allow users to search and filter products in real-time.

#### 3. Add to Cart

Enhance the add-to-cart functionality:
- Ensure the cart updates correctly and quickly.
- Improve user experience despite a slow backend.

#### 4. Checkout Phase

Implement the checkout process, which includes:
- Cart summary and final price
- Delivery address and slot selection
- Payment method
- Order confirmation

### Documentation

Please document your code and any decisions or assumptions made during the implementation. This will help us understand your thought process.
